## 2D Pong Game

The famous 2D Pong Game made with HTML5 Canvas and Vanilla Javascript

## Motivation

For all those looking foward to learn Javascript and become a great developer, I highly recommend doing a game like this. It demands lots of thoughts on logic and organization of your code, pushing you to think deeply about every aspect of the application.
Although it is a simple game, it is amazing how much I've learned doing it.

## Tech

* HTML5
* Javascript

## How to play

You're in charge of the left paddle and can control it with your mouse (or mousepad). The closest to the center the ball hits, the straightest it will return. So it's more effective to try strike the ball with the edges of your paddle, making the game a little more challenging. Also, when you hit the ball with the edges, the speed increases, making it harder for your opponent.

The player scores a point when the ball passes through the rival and hits the other margin. The first player to score 5 points win the game.
